 * The only Rovers that appear to have images returned by the NASA Mars Imager API.  There are definitely more rovers that
 * have gone to Mars and imaged the surface but I didn't have time to see if the API would return those images.
 *
 * The book __The Martian__ heavily references and uses Pathfinder as a source of both comedy and plot development.  I
 *  highly recommend reading it if you haven't yet as the movie adaptation doesn't do it justice!
